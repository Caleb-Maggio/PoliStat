            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The American presidential election is more than just a political event; it's a 
                defining moment in U.S. history and governance. Every four years, citizens across 
                the country engage in a process that ultimately decides who will lead the nation. 
                But how did this process come to be, and what are the key elements that make it 
                so pivotal?</p>
        
            <h2>History of American Presidential Elections</h2>
            <p>The first U.S. presidential election took place in 1789, electing George Washington
                as the nation's first president. Since then, the process has evolved significantly.
                 The introduction of political parties, changes in voting rights, and the shift 
                 from state-controlled elections to a more centralized system have all shaped the 
                 current election framework.</p>
